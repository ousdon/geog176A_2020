Hello!!! [Poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roses_Are_Red) Roses are red. Violets are blue. This is my first webpage using R to create a website, and it's very excited to using R on GIS work. I am hoping to learn more on technology that learn with GIS materials. This year is my second year at UCSB, before that, I am study at Mt. San Antonio College and work with my parttime job at resrtaurant and boba store. I hope this year can learn more GIS work so I can improve my skills.
