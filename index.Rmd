Hello!!! This is my first webpage using R to create a website, and it's very excited to using R on GIS work. I am hoping to learn more on technology that learn with GIS materials. This year is my second year at UCSB, before that, I am study at Mt. San Antonio College and work with my parttime job at resrtaurant and boba store. I hope this year can learn more GIS work so I can improve my skills. In this lab, I learn how to build my first website and it's very useful to begin with R.
